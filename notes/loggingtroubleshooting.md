# Logging and Troubleshooting

## Topics Practiced
- Locating logs under /var/log
- Reviewing logs around incident timeframes
- Correlating log entries with system behavior

## Approach
I focus on identifying patterns, timestamps, and errors that align with reported symptoms, rather than scanning logs indiscriminately.
